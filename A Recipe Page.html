    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a karahi or deep pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>

        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>

        <li>Add red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the mutton pieces and cook on high heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the karahi, and let the mutton cook for about 1.5 to 2 hours or until tender. Stir occasionally and add water if needed to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Once the mutton is cooked, increase the heat to medium-high and cook uncovered for another 10-15 minutes to thicken the gravy.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle garam masala and mix well. Cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
